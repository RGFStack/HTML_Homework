      <h2>Company History</h2>

        <p>
          Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known
          as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939.[5][6]
          Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding
          into the emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of
          comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's
          offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the
          titles of editor, managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham
          Goodman (Martin's brother)[7] officially listed as publisher.[6]
          Timely's first publication, Marvel Comics #1 (cover dated Oct. 1939),
          included the first appearance of Carl Burgos' android superhero the
          Human Torch, and the first appearances of Bill Everett's anti-hero
          Namor the Sub-Mariner,[8] among other features.[5] The issue was a
          great success; it and a second printing the following month sold a
          combined nearly 900,000 copies.[9] While its contents came from an
          outside packager, Funnies, Inc.,[5] Timely had its own staff in place
          by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist
          Joe Simon, teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first
          patriotically themed superheroes,[10] Captain America, in Captain
          America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of
          nearly one million.[9] Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning
          with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.[3][11] While no
          other Timely character would achieve the success of these three
          characters, some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in
          modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer, Miss
          America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel. Timely
          also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton's best-known
          features, "Powerhouse Pepper",[12][13] as well as a line of children's
          talking animal comics featuring characters like Super Rabbit and the
          duo Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal. Goodman hired his wife's 16-year-old
          cousin,[14] Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939.[15]
          When editor Simon left the company in late 1941,[16] Goodman made
          Lieber—by then writing pseudonymously as "Stan Lee"—interim editor of
          the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three
          years during his military service in World War II. Lee wrote
          extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different titles.
          Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and
          comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of
          the same office and with the same staff.[3] One of these shell
          companies through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel
          Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May 1944). As well, some
          comics' covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946–47), were
          labeled "A Marvel Magazine" many years before Goodman would formally
          adopt the name in 1961.[17] The company begin identifying the group of
          its comic division as Marvel Comic Group, on some comics cover-dated
          November 1948, when the company set up an in-house editorial board to
          compete with the likes of DC and Fawcett, even though the legal name
          is still Timely.[18][19][20] Magazine Management / Atlas Comics Main
          article: Atlas Comics (1950s) The post-war American comic market saw
          superheroes falling out of fashion.[21] Goodman's comic book line
          dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of
          genres than even Timely had published, featuring horror, Westerns,
          humor, talking animal, men's adventure-drama, giant monster, crime,
          and war comics, and later adding jungle books, romance titles,
          espionage, and even medieval adventure, Bible stories and sports.
          Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the
          newsstand-distribution company he owned,[22] on comics cover-dated
          November 1951 even though another company, Kable News, continued to
          distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues.[23] This globe
          branding united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and
          freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith
          Publications.[24] Atlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of
          following popular trends in television and films—Westerns and war
          dramas prevailing for a time, drive-in film monsters another time—and
          even other comic books, particularly the EC horror line.[25] Atlas
          also published a plethora of children's and teen humor titles,
          including Dan DeCarlo's Homer the Happy Ghost (similar to Casper the
          Friendly Ghost) and Homer Hooper (à la Archie Andrews). Atlas
          unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to
          mid-1954, with the Human Torch (art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers,
          variously), the Sub-Mariner (drawn and most stories written by Bill
          Everett), and Captain America (writer Stan Lee, artist John Romita
          Sr.). Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and, according to Stan
          Lee, survived chiefly because it produced work quickly, cheaply, and
          at a passable quality.[26] In 1957, Goodman switched distributors to
          the American News Company—which shortly afterward lost a Justice
          Department lawsuit and discontinued its business.[27] Atlas was left
          without distribution and was forced to turn to Independent News, the
          distribution arm of its biggest rival, National (DC) Comics, which
          imposed draconian restrictions on Goodman's company. As then-Atlas
          editor Stan Lee recalled in a 1988 interview, "[We had been] turning
          out 40, 50, 60 books a month, maybe more, and ... suddenly we went ...
          to either eight or 12 books a month, which was all Independent News
          Distributors would accept from us."[28] The company was briefly
          renamed to Goodman Comics in 1957 under the distribution deal with
          Independent News.[29]
