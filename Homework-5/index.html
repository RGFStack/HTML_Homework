          Captain America is a superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby who
          appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The
          character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1, published on
          December 20, 1940, by Timely Comics, a corporate predecessor to
          Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is Steven "Steve" Rogers,
          a frail man enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an
          experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the United States
          Army to aid the country's efforts in World War II. Equipped with an
          American flag–inspired costume and a virtually indestructible shield,
          Captain America and his sidekick Bucky Barnes clashed frequently with
          the villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the
          final days of the war, an accident left Captain America frozen in a
          state of suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. He
          resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the
          superhero team the Avengers, but frequently struggles as a "man out of
          time" to adjust to the new era. The character quickly emerged as
          Timely's most popular and commercially successful wartime creation
          upon his original publication, though the popularity of superheroes
          declined in the post-war period and Captain America Comics was
          discontinued in 1950. The character saw a short-lived revival in 1953
          before returning to comics in 1964, and has since remained in
          continuous publication. Captain America's creation as an explicitly
          anti-Nazi figure was a deliberately political undertaking: Simon and
          Kirby were stridently opposed to the actions of Nazi Germany and
          supporters of U.S. intervention in World War II, with Simon conceiving
          of the character specifically in response to the American
          non-interventionism movement. Political messages have subsequently
          remained a defining feature of Captain America stories, with writers
          regularly using the character to comment on the state of American
          society and government. Having appeared in more than ten thousand
          stories in more than five thousand media formats, Captain America is
          one of the most popular and recognized Marvel Comics characters, and
          has been described as an icon of American popular culture. Though
          Captain America was not the first United States–themed superhero, he
          would become the most popular and enduring of the many patriotic
          American superheroes created during World War II. Captain America was
          the first Marvel character to appear in a medium outside of comic
          books, in the 1944 serial film Captain America; the character has
          subsequently appeared in a variety of films and other media, including
          the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he was portrayed by actor Chris
          Evans from the character's first appearance in Captain America: The
          First Avenger (2011) to his final appearance in Avengers: Endgame
          (2019).

          Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel
          Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he
          first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August
          1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic
          books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.
          Spider-Man has the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker.
          Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school student and an
          orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his
          parents, Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko,
          and later creators had the character deal with the struggles of
          adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting
          characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry
          Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black
          Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom.
          In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider powers and
          abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers
          include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability,
          coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a
          spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called
          "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that
          shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for
          fighting and travel, or "web swinging" across the city. Peter Parker
          initially used his powers for his personal gain, but after his Uncle
          Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use
          his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man. Before Spider-Man
          first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books
          were usually relegated to the protagonist's sidekick role. The
          Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high
          school student from the Queens borough of New York City, as
          Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
          inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
          relate.[8] While Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike
          previous teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no
          superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he had learned the
          lesson for himself that "with great power comes great responsibility"
          —a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first
          Spider-Man's origin story, but later retroactively attributed to the
          late Uncle Ben Parker.

          The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
          Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the
          character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk
          (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has
          dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the
          alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking, and muscular humanoid
          possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego
          Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and
          emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each
          other. Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving
          the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb,
          Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to
          emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often
          leads to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's
          civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is usually conveyed
          proportionate to his anger level. Commonly portrayed as a raging
          savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos, from a
          mindless, destructive force (War) to a brilliant warrior
          (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (the Devil Hulk), a genius
          scientist in his own right (Doc Green), and a gangster (Joe Fixit).
